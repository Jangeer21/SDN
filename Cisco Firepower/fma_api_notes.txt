FMC API notes:
1)Make sure REST API interface is enabled
2)Need an account with permissions to access the REST API in one or more domains.
3)Cisco recommends that you use different accounts for interfacing with the API and the Firepower User Interface.
4)The first time you connect to the REST API you may receive an error that the connection is not secure due to an invalid certificate. Add an exception in your browser to use the certificate and accept the connection.
5)Guy on video has FDM (version 6.6), wheras client has FMC (version 7.0.1)
